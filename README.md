# comparison-of-DCGAN-CGAN-On-Fashion-MNIST-Dataset

This repository contains code for comparison of DCGAN and CGAN On Fashion MNIST Dataset. Key components are:

- Fashion MNIST
- Preprocessing: Normalization, Resizing
- Traing of the discriminator and the generator of both models were trained for 100 epochs with a batch size of 128. Adam optimizer was used with a learning rate of 0.0002 and a beta value of 0.5. 
- Comparison in discriinator loss, generator loss and gan loss between both the Models

## Requirements

- Numpy
- keras
- Matplotlib
